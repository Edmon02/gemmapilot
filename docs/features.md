# Features and Functionality

GemmaPilot is packed with features designed to make you a more productive developer. Here's a detailed look at what you can do with it.

## Core AI Capabilities

### Context-Aware Chat

At the heart of GemmaPilot is a powerful, context-aware chat interface. You can ask questions, get explanations, and brainstorm ideas with the AI. The chat is "context-aware," which means it has access to your workspace, the current file, and any code you have selected. This allows the AI to provide more relevant and accurate answers.

**Use Case:** You're working on a complex function and you're not sure how it works. You can select the function, and then ask GemmaPilot to "explain this code." GemmaPilot will then provide a detailed explanation of the function, taking into account the surrounding code and any other relevant files in your workspace.

### File Analysis

GemmaPilot can analyze your files and provide you with a detailed report. You can ask it to give you an overview of a file, identify potential issues, suggest improvements, or list the dependencies.

**Use Case:** You've inherited a legacy codebase and you're not sure where to start. You can use the file analysis feature to get a high-level overview of each file, which will help you to understand the structure of the project and identify any potential areas of concern.

### Code Completion

GemmaPilot provides intelligent code completion suggestions as you type. It uses the context of your code to provide you with relevant and accurate completions.

**Use Case:** You're writing a new function and you're not sure what to type next. GemmaPilot will provide you with a list of suggestions based on the code you've already written.

### File Attachment

You can attach files to your chat messages, which allows you to ask questions about specific files.

**Use Case:** You're working on a bug and you've found a log file that contains some useful information. You can attach the log file to a chat message and ask GemmaPilot to "analyze this log file and tell me what went wrong."

### Workspace Integration

GemmaPilot has access to your entire workspace, which allows it to provide more relevant and accurate answers.

**Use Case:** You're working on a new feature and you need to make changes to several files. You can ask GemmaPilot to "refactor the `User` class to use the new `Database` class," and it will be able to find all the relevant files and make the necessary changes.

### Command Execution

GemmaPilot can execute commands in your terminal. It will always ask for your permission before executing a command, and it includes a security check to prevent dangerous commands from being executed.

**Use Case:** You're working on a new project and you need to install some dependencies. You can ask GemmaPilot to "install the dependencies for this project," and it will generate the necessary `npm install` or `pip install` command and then ask for your permission to execute it.

## Beautiful Interface

GemmaPilot's user interface is a clean and modern WebView that is integrated directly into VS Code. It supports Markdown and code rendering, so you can have a rich and interactive experience.

## Privacy and Security

GemmaPilot is designed with privacy and security in mind. All of the AI processing is done on your local machine, so your code never leaves your computer. It also includes a command approval system and a dangerous command filter to help keep you safe.
